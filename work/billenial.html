      Billenial is a Financial Mobile Application designed for Millennials. Simply put, it consolidates your bills and your banks all onto one platform. Simply connect your bank cards and your bills and that’s it. Never miss a bill payment and know exactly when due dates are with Billenial’s notification system. Pay any bill with any bank card. Because we know paying bills will never be fun but it might as well be easy.</p>
      <p>
      Billenial is a startup founded by Eloise and Jamari Ambursley. While on our trip to Europe, we were on pursuit to find the next big idea. It came to us after a few months from that trip. Having to face reality again and the adult life of paying bills, this particular consumer pain bothered us, then we realized that this problem was a great opportunity and we wanted to solve it. With our backgrounds, mine in design, Jamari in tech and both working in Laurentian Bank in Toronto’s Financial District, we believe we are well equipped to pursue this project.

      Below is a roadmap and vision until the end of this year. Recently, we were accepted into Sandbox’s Basecamp program by DMZ. We’re building relations with enterprises and working through our prototype. Our official website is www.billenialapp.com. I am currently building this website. Stay tuned for when our beta launches!

  <h3>Brand Visual Identity</h3><br/>
<p><strong>The Name:</strong> Billenial was inspired by our main target market and our app’s main feature. It simply sounded right to combine Bills and Millenial! To test how this name resonated with people, I went around my college campus and asked students what they thought of or how they felt when they heard the word “Billenial.” The response I received was positive. The majority of those I’ve surveyed said that it sounded like a brand made for them, Millennials. Also, they said the name makes the app sound new, bright, and important.Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Maecenas faucibus mollis interdum. Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros. Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Integer posuere erat a ante venenatis dapibus posuere velit aliquet.</p>
 
 <p><strong>The Symbol:</strong> After several iterations, I decided to combine a star and a ribbon. Often, we associate stars to “a new beginning” or “good quality.” And that is exactly what Billenial is all about, a new beginning in how we go about our finances and we will be able to do this through the quality of service the application promises to provide. The ribbon represents “a coming together.” Billenial is not here to compete with banks, rather to partner with them. With the ribbon effect, it softens the star’s points and makes it more friendly and circular, giving the effect that we are all equal.</p>
 
  <p><strong>The Colours:</strong> Since Billenial is a product of Canada, it was fitting to make the logo colourful because of the amazing diversity we have in our country. Also, Billenial brings banks and bills together into one platform, which means there will be a combination of colours that will need to be organized and not distracting. Six different colours, but all have a specific purpose. Each colour catagorizes and is intuitive to users because each colour is universal in its meaning. For example, green means “Go” or “Good” and red means “Important” which demands attention.</p>

  <h3>Font</h3><br/>
<p><strong>Logo Font:</strong> I wanted the logo name to reflect the idea of youthfulness yet still maintained professionalism. So I chose a sans serif typeface, ITC Avande Garde Gothic in the weight Medium. This font is round and friendly yet strong and solid. I slightly customized the font to round the corners of the letters to make it softer and adjusted the kerning between the letters to make it more open. It was a brand decision to make all the letters lower case to maintain our value in “equality.”</p>
  
  <p><strong>Body Font:</strong> The most important thing about body copy is legibility, hence the decision to use Helvetica. When Steve Jobs was creating the Apple1, he chose Helvetica to be the main body copy because on screen it is legibile and flexible with its many different weights. Even today, this fact stands true, so I decided to stick to Helvetica, though I am also concidering The San Francisco Typeface by Apple perhaps later on as Billenial evolves.</p>

  <h3>User Persona</h3><br/>
<p><strong>Meet Stephanie:</strong>  Orignally from Alberta, Stephanie moved to Toronto with her dog, Pete, to study Biology at Ryerson University. Currently, she lives in a 1 bedroom apartment off campus. Her sources of income are her student loan, the money she makes as a part-time cashier at Tim Hortons, and occassional money that her parents send to her from time to time. On top of her school tuition and text books, her other expenses are a TTC monthly Metro Pass, a cellphone bill, rent, food, internet and cable bill, hydro, dog food, and of course miscellaneous things like shopping and weekly social activities that a typical university student would like to participate in.

This is Stephanie’s first time away from home. She’s pretty responsible, taking care of her dog has made her think outside of just herself. However, Stephanie doesn’t want work and bills to get in the way of her college experience.</p>

  <h3>MARKET RESEARCH &amp; POTENTIAL</h3><br/>
<p><strong>Secondary Research:</strong> As the demand continues to move towards digital banking, banks find it difficult to keep up with digital trends because these large corporations have many other internal things to worry about. This is why Banks like BMO and Scotiabank have invested in Tech Accelerators like The DMZ to fund potential Fintech startups that can assist in their digital sectors. In Canada alone, FinTech and InsurTech have been catching the eyes of VC’s and Angel Investors.</p>
 
 <p>As for Millenials when it comes to banking, more and more are moving their money to banks like Tangerine Bank and EQ Bank to satisfy their need for mobile convenience. According to popular research, Millenials prioritize convenience over security, hence we are not afraid to send money, move money, and make purchases online. According to firstdata.com, mobile payments are expected to reach close to $90 billion by the end of 2017. Moreover, 48% of Millennials are interested in real-time and forward-looking spending analysis and 41% of twentysomethings downloaded a money management app. Additionally, 43% list online banking as the first or second most valuable aspect of their day-to-day banking experience. Below demonstrates further statistic that have been recently collected about Millennials and their relation to banking.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Primary Research:</strong> In addition to my secondary research, I’ve conducted primary research through surveying students at my college and 2 other colleges in the GTA. 80% of my findings demonstrate that students have at least 2 reocurring bills, typically a cellphone bill and a credit card bill. Of this group, at least 85% have aquired late fees or other additional fees because most have not set up pre-authorized payment and rely on either SMS or email notifications. 78% said they cared about their finances but only 15% actually paid close attention to the details of their bills and make inquiries about them. When asked why, responses I’ve received were that they were too busy with life, meaning school work, social life, work, and other responsibilities or they’’ve said that managing bills was just too tedious and annoying to manage. Finally, 90% agreed that a mobile application that provided bill notifications for every bill with the capabilities of linking all your bank cards would greatly benefit them to the betterment of their lives.</p>
